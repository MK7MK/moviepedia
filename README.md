5. personal details information for logged users

TOOLS:-
 OPERATING SYSTEM:-
 • Microsoft Windows 

FRONTEND :-
• Html 
• Css 
• Javascript
 These tools will be used to create for the frontend design of the web application.

BACKEND :-
• DATABASE: mangodb
• Framework
• Nodejs
These tools can be used to create a server-side interface which will make the input validated by the user is stored and the objective behind the input is fulfilled.

STAKEHOLDERS:-
The system would be used by following people:-

External stakeholder:-
A)	Direct users
1. movie enthusiasts
2. youtubers, video editors, Bloggers
	B)   Secondary Users
		1. Streaming Outlets
		2. Reviewers

Internal Stakeholders:-

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS:-
The following requirement detail the major functions that the system must perform.
REQ-1: The user must be able to login/signup using his/her email password o authenticated using his/her google/ facebook account.

REQ-3: The system keeps track of the movie details in its database and should be updated when the admin adds an item or removes it.
REQ-4: The search mechanism yields a negative result, when an item is not present in the database and provides the item if it present.  The search mechanism should be user interactive by having a auto-complete feature.

MODULE DESCRIPTION:-
Module-1:-
This module contains with the landing page for our web application.  It will include a login/signup option for the user with a user authentication.
Module-2: -

PROCESS MODEL: 
The process model we plan to use for this project is Agile Model. Since our web application is user friendly and feature-driven we plan to follow the EXtreme programming method under Agile.  
XP allows for a test-driven development which is the most suitable for us as we need to run our modules through multiple iterations of tests to check for its correctness. 
This method allows us to do pair programming which will be beneficial for our team since we are a team of 3 members and each one can take the responsibility for a pair of modules which will ensure that each module is well built and debugged. 
This method also allows for continuous integration of codes written by the developers and this feature of XP allows us to integrate the model and test it iteratively.  This will help us in adding smaller features like auto-complete/voice enabled search as continuous integration allows for easy adding of new features.
